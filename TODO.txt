ToDo: June 22, 2017
-------------------
pingparser.py:

  > Consolidate `format_replacements`, currently a list of tuples, then
    duplicated in return statement of parse() function.

    Make it an ordered dict and use it to build `default_format` and
    JSON return value.

    `default_format` should only be built JIT since it's not used when:
        * pingparser is used as a library (i.e. when just calling parse() on results).
        * when different formatting is given on the command line

  > NOTE: pulled from my (ssteinerX) inline comments.  Not sure exactly what I meant...it's not specific enough, but says:
    "Make `minmax_matcher` more specific i.e. match a bit before the '=' sign"

  > Completely remove "+" parameter formatting.
    See related NOTE:s in pingparser.py near text: "+...format string"
